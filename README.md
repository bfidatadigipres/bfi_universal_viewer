Once these are installed, git clone this repository to your file system, then run the following commands in your terminal:

```
cd bfi_universal_viewer
npm install
npm start
```

Then browse to `localhost:42001`. (This test instance on port 42001, already installed UV running on port 5000).

The uv_start.sh script can be run on crontab to check whether the universal viewer is running, and start it if it is not.
